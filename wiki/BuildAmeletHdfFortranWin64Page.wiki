= Introduction =

To build amelethdf fortran with ifort v11.1, you need:
 * Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.,
 * amelethdf-fortran sources 
 * HDF5 version 1.8.6 library (http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current/bin/windows/hdf5-1.8.6-win64-cmake-shared.zip)

Create a static library project in Visual Studio 2008: 
 * File/New/Project

Import fortran amelethdf library sources files. There are in src/amelethdf:
 * Do a right clic on the Source Files present in the Solution Explorer and choose the menu Add Existing Item, and select all f90 files present in src/amelethdf
 * Open the configuration manager and select x64 for Active Solution platfom

Add hdf5 include directories:

 * these include directories :
    * C:\....\HDF5_1.8.6\include  
    * C:\....\HDF5_1.8.6\include\fortran
    * C:\....\amelethdf\x64\Debug
 * these libraries to the linker options (configuration properties/linker/input):
    * zlib1.lib
    * szip.lib 
    * hdf5dll.lib
    * hdf5_hldll.lib
    * hdf5_fortrandll.lib
    * hdf5_hl_fortrandll.lib 
    * amelethdf.lib

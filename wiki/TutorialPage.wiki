#summary Amelet-HDF tutorial.

= Bistatic RCS example =

This tutorial starts from a functional point of view : a bistatic rcs. The simulation Amelet-HDF input file is deduced step by step. Finally, the simulation Amelet-HDF output
file is detailed as well.

= Computing Electric field with Nec =

The tutorial drives the reader in the computation of electric field alongside a dipole with the well known software Nec :

 * The Amelet-HDF simulation input file is generated by a tool written in Python
 * This input file is read from fortran to create native input information for Nec
 * Nec run is performed
 * The output file created by Nec is parsed in fortran and an Amelet-HDF output file is     written.
